        <h2>Tennis</h2>
        <p>For the last year, my co-workers and I have been playing Tennis during lunch break. It is a great way to bring exercise into the otherwise sedentary workday. Most of the time we have 4-5 people playing, which calls for some fun ways to implement all our players. At the start, it was just me and one other player, and we got very good at singles that year.</p>

        <h2>Field Goal Kicking</h2>
        <p>Since January 2024, I've been learning how to kick a proper field goal. I broke my first kicking tee and upgraded to a proper holder. My record is about 43 yards, but I struggle to keep my kicks consistent. It's a very mental task and is easy to psych yourself out and shank a ball. I've learned to keep a ritual to help perform consistently. Looking forward to hopefully get a 50 yard kick.</p>
